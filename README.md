# Exploration of Ford GoBike Trip Data
## by Wajeeh Alaidaroos 


## Dataset

> The dataset here is about Ford GoBike Trip data. Ford GoBike is the Bay Areaâ€™s newest transportation option. The system will serve San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, Berkeley and Emeryville. And Ford GoBike rapidly grow to 7,000 bikes at 546 stations by the end of 2018.
> Ford GoBike Trip data describes members gender, birth year, memberships' type does he subscribed or a customer, start stations names, end stations names with theirs' latitudes and longitudes, and trip durations in seconds.


## Summary of Findings

> * About three-quarters of Ford GoBike's riders are males by 74.6%, then females are 23%, and other genders are 2.1%.
> * The most frequent trip durations is between 4-6 minutes, and after 6 minutes of the trip duration, the frequency decreases as we increasing the trip duration.
> * From the age of 20 up to 75, most of the people who ride Ford GoBike's bicycles are between the age of 26 and 35, and the frequency decreases after the age of 33.
> * Females are spending more trip duration than Males by a few different, the median of Females trip duration is 10 minutes and colse to 30 minutes as a maximum, and for Males the median is about 9 minutes, and the maximum reaches 24 minutes, without taking outliers in consideration.
> * In all age stages between 20s and up to 70s, females spend more trip duration than males except male who's age stage in the 70s, he spend lesser time than females in the same age stage. And most of the trip duration of these ages stages are between 10 minutes up to 15 minutes.
